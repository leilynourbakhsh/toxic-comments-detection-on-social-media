# toxic-comments-detection-on-social-media
In this project, I used several deep learning algorithms for text processing. Our data contains toxic comments and data is gathered from kaggle in toxic comments classifier
contest. I used LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, CNN, CNN-LSTM, Bi-Directional GRU for Classification the data into toxic and non-toxic. Bi-Directional GRU has a better result in our data.
